# <type> list:
#   feat     (new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script)
#   fix      (bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script)
#   docs     (changes to the documentation)
#   style    (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change)
#   refactor (refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable)
#   test     (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
#   chore    (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

# <subject> line:
# - Limit to 50 characters
# - Capitalize the subject line
# - Do not end with a period
# - Use the imperative mood in the subject line
# - Separate subject from body with a blank line
# - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

# Example:
# feat: Add beta sequence
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72 characters or so.
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
# - Bullet points are okay, too
# - Use a hyphen or asterisk for the bullet, followed by a single space, with blank lines in between
